Q: Meaning of Life?
A: No global meaning. You can choose only for  you. Yeah. For me - get money, friend, expirience, photos, stuff, gifts, educations, good karma.
   And coomon - need life and dead with possibility of reboring in best forms. People male form. Not stone, not oil, not gas, not air, not fire, 
   not emptyness, not sound, not word, not animal, for plant. People male form - for me is best for of reboring. I want to save it for next life.
   
Q: How to reborn people?
A: Need to understand, who are you at this moment. If plant, or animal, not people. Mediatate for who you are. Meditate for how you degradate to this form.
   Next - meditate for how to evolute to best form.
   
Q: How to meditate? What is it?
A: Meditaion very simple practice. It's not a beathing. It's not a gym. Not a common yoga. It's not a singing. It's not a repiating mantras. It's not a
   game. It's not a work. It's not a drink. It's not a dope. It's not a sleep. It's not a dream. It's not an imaginations. It's not a void. 
   It's not a meeting. It's not a sex. It's not a fun. It's serionus deal. How?
   For first, you need to staying alone. Only you ands you. And no internet, radio, books, TV, eats, drinks, dope, stuff, music, game, friends, work,
   entertaments, and co communications.
   dStay alone and start to saying what you want. For example, if you want yo understand to who are you, you need you to say this simple question.
   Say loud. Loud as possible. Scream. Who are you? What is youself? And you can find an answer.
   Next you can ask, how to evalute to humen form? And you can answer. It will be an only your way. Not form another. I don't know you way. 
   Find it.
   Get lucky.s
   
   And be carefull - when I meditated - saying, aksing my self, my brother and family put me to the jail. Psychiatric jail. Saying wait I schizophrnic, 
   saying with myself. If you try to meditate with family or friend, collective - another can call to police.
   In Russian - it's normal deal. Meditation - illegal action.
   Thank you Putin!
