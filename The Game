The Game: Life
---
The Game is not a computer game, not a card game, not a child game, not a role game, not an AD&D.
The Game - is Life.
If you don't play the Game you are just a slave. Just a trash. It's like the Matrix. Enter the Game - exit from the Matrix (the Matrix - famous Hollywood American TV movie).
Life without the Game like life in a jail. Enter the Game is a jail break. It's a freedom for you.

Remember: for the Game don't need a computer or smartphone. Need only youself, and your waitness.

It's like a computer game, but playing character - it's YOU. Game - life.
Meaning of a game - live a long happy life.
You can educate, work, meditate, create, talk, travel, watch TV, read a books, play PC, use smartphone and internet, write a letters, make a bussiness,
go to jail, marrage, have childer, pray, plant a grass, collect a money, take dept, being a president or minister, work polic, have a sex, nice a dream,
use a dope, drunk, burn campfire, war, fight, collect a frined, imaginate, be silent, be void, be full, be free, be busy, be famuos, record a music,

You can do anything then you want.
You will be fullment free.

Only ask for you: you want to play a game, or you want to stay unfree, jailed?
Game is free. Ticket is free. 
Any day you can enter the game, or do out. 
If you will fail the rules, you may be disconnected. 
Remember it.
Disconneted by the leader. 
Or disconnected by vote of all players.
Connectins only by full vote of players.
If you start the war with another game players, you will be disconnected.
Be peacefull and carefull. Be lovefull. Be soul. Be clever. Be mindfull. Be TRUST!!!!!!!!!

Game is not a secret, from today every person can say about it. 
Free talks.
