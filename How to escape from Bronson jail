What is Satory?
It's when you solute your Tarot-cards. It's near your left leg. Near left butt. See and meditate to solute. Write clever resolution to you secret 
program-type. To real type. Program-type near left above your head. Or may be not.
When you resolute every your Tarot, you karma, you will be get Satory statement.
Tarot keep karma your this life.


What is Badhichitta?
It's possible after Satory. It's not Tarot. It's about your micro-sleeps (dreams). Splashes. Meditate about it, and type code.
Micro-sleeps keep karma of previous lifes.

When you got Satory, you will be free from this life karma.
